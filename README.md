# Baby Steps

This is a WordPress Theme starting point. It contains the absolute minimum amount of code which you need in order to building out a site using the WordPress Site Editor.

It really is all-but completely empty and will not output **anything** on the website until you start buidling using the Site Editor. Start with the index.html template: for example, add the Post Content Block to get the page content to appear.

Once you get going, you'll probably want to start using the [Create Block Theme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/) plugin to save out your changes to files in a theme of your own.
